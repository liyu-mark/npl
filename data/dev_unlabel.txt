b'117851|t|[Immunochemical study of heterogenous antigens Y. pestis EV similar to human red cells].
117851|a|Franctions containing heterogenous antigens Y. pestis EV similar to human red cells can be obtained by the method of immunosorption of antigens by fixed antibodies on polyacrylamide gel.
Furthermore, splenic macrophages seem to be required for the interaction of primed T-cells with heat-killed Y. pestis.
Similar enhancement was provided by supernatant fluids of spleen cultures from immunized mice but not by those from unimmunized mice.
Pretreatment of spleen cells with rabbit hyperimmune antiserum to mouse brain theta-antigen plus complement caused a reduction in the enhancing capacity of the spleen cell culture fluids.
Y.pestis is in India, Middle East, Madagascar, North America, and Brisbane.
